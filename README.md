# ðŸš• Taxi Fare Prediction Website ðŸš–

## Overview

The Taxi Fare Prediction website allows users to predict the fare of a taxi ride in New York City. By entering details such as the pickup and dropoff locations, the time of day, and the number of passengers, users can get an estimated fare.

This project was developed as part of the Le Wagon data science bootcamp in Lisbon and showcases various skills including:

- Data preprocessing and analysis
- Machine learning model deployment
- Frontend web development using Streamlit
- API development and integration

## API

The frontend is connected to a backend API that handles the fare prediction logic. The API is hosted in a separate repository. For more details, check out my [Taxi Fare API](https://github.com/AntQua/data-fast-api) repo on GitHub.

### API Endpoints

- **`/predict`**: Returns a fare prediction based on the provided ride details.


## Features

- **User-friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive form for entering ride details.
- **Real-time Prediction:** Instant fare predictions based on user inputs.
