# ðŸš• Taxi Fare Prediction Website ðŸš–

Welcome to the Taxi Fare Prediction website! This project was created as part of the Le Wagon Data Science bootcamp in Lisbon. The goal of the project is to build a web application that predicts taxi fares in New York City based on user inputs.

## About the Project

This project is an end-to-end web application that predicts taxi fares in New York City. It utilizes machine learning models to provide fare predictions based on user input such as pick-up and drop-off locations, and the time of day. The project was created as an exercise during the Le Wagon Data Science bootcamp.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Streamlit**: For front-end development.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for model building.
- **Geopy**: For geographic calculations.
- **Google Cloud**: For cloud storage of models and data.
- **Docker**: For containerization.

## Features

- Predict taxi fares based on pick-up and drop-off locations.
- Input date and time to see how they affect fare prices.
- User-friendly web interface.
- Deployed on Streamlit for easy access.
